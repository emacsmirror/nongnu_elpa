## unreleased

- `eldoc-diffstat-setup` has been replaced by a minor mode
  `eldoc-diffstat-mode`; there's also a globalized minor mode
  `global-eldoc-diffstat-mode` that (by default) will turn on diffstat output in
  all supported major modes.
- `eldoc-diffstat-lines` can be used to truncate/pad output to a specific number
  of lines.
