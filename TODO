*) Fix bugs when marking threads by "M T"
*) Better IMAP support, i.e. just fetch headers, sync, offline, search
*) Virtual folders every where, i.e. only one physical folder.  VM should
  not read the folder into a buffer, but only qurey relevant messages from
  an maildb-backend.

*) for text/alternative messages, when the plain text part is
   displayed internally, [add variable that will allow to] show icon
   for the html (or rich text) part, which will allow to delete it
   easily using $d.  I now have to edit these by hand...

*) The binding of mouse-3 overrides the usual usage of mouse-3 which
   is very useful.  An option to allow binding this menu to another
   key (C-mouse-3?) would be great.

*) when attachments appear with no empty line separating them from the
   text, the attachment icon appears on the same line as the text
   before it.  this results in poor appearance (I think), Would be
   much nicer to show the attachment icon on a separate line, rather
   than continued on the last text line as now.

*) Typing h when in the presentation window makes vm display only a
   single windows with headers rather than adding a headers window to
   the presentation mode window. (when in vm, change to presentation
   buffer, type C-x1 and then h"

*) When reading mail I have the frame divided into three windows:
   headers, presentation and BBDB.  When replying from the header
   window, the reply window just replaces the headers window, leaving
   the presentation window and the BBDB window unchanged.  The
   resulting reply window is too small...  would be good to have it
   replace all three windows (headers, presentation, BBDB) until the
   reply is sent.
