* fj.el

This repo contains some extremely basic functions for interacting with a Forgejo instance (such as [[https://codeberg.org][codeberg.org]]) from within Emacs.

It doesn't interact with =forge= / =magit=, which don't implement Gitea/Forgejo support and likely never will. Nor does it attempt to follow their wonderful design (for now).

It just aims to cover a few of the bread and butter functions that will save you switching to the browser 80% of the time.
