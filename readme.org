* fj.el

This repo contains some basic functions for interacting with a Forgejo instance (such as [[https://codeberg.org][codeberg.org]]) from within Emacs.

It doesn't interact with =forge= / =magit=, which don't implement Gitea/Forgejo support and likely never will (see https://github.com/magit/forge/discussions/557). Nor does it attempt to follow their wonderful design (for now).

It just aims to cover a few of the bread and butter functions that will save you switching to the browser 80% of the time.

* getting started

To get going, first set =fj-host=,  =fj-user=, and =fj-token=. You can obtain a token from your profile settings on your Forgejo instance.

* repositories

Current repository detection should work partially automatically. If you find you are still being asked for the repo when calling a command from inside a repo with a Forgejo remote, check to make sure the local root directory matches the name of the Forgejo repo!

* features

Forgejo's API is vast. Currently =fj.el= just implements a few basic things:

- search and list instance repos
- list user's repos
- star repos from repo listing


- rich create/edit issue/comment interface.


- list repo issues
- act on issue from issues listing (edit, edit title, comment, close, reopen, delete)
- view issue discussion (and act on issue as above)


- list PRs and view PR discussion


- create repo

* dependencies
- =magit-post=, =magit-process= (for obtaining current repo)
- [[https://codeberg.org/martianh/fedi.el][fedi.el]]

* commands index
