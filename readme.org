* =tp.el=

Some functions, classes and methods to make it easier to create transient
menus that send complex POST, PUT, or PATCH requests to JSON APIs.

For more about transient, see https://github.com/magit/transient.

NB: the code is very green so there'll likely be breaking changes.

A typical use-case is where you have a single endpoint that takes many
different parameters. It's handy for a user to be able to set all the
options, then make a single request to change all the settings on the
server. It's also expected that they'll be able to view all the current
settings on the server, and make modifications to them for sending.

The classes and methods define some transient behaviours that make sense
for dealing with APIs:

- We handle fetching and saving current server settings, and initialize
  our transients with the values fetched
- We compare the state of a current transient option against the server
  values
- We distinguish the formatting of server settings and current transient
  setting
- When reading a string from the user, we provide the server setting as
  default input
- We can seemlessly handle making requests with arrays, i.e. =source[key]=,
  or =field[1][name]= parameters
- We can easily fetch an infix's allowed values for =completing-read=
- We (ususally) only send changed values to the server.

* classes

We define three classes for our infixes, all subclassed off
=transient-option=.

We also implement format-value and read methods to customize their behaviour.

** =tp-option=

Our generic option class, from which our other classes inherit.

Behaviour:

- Format: show selected option, highlighted if changed, commented if default
- Read: prompt to select an option using =completing-read=

By default we always read, which means calling an infix never unsets it,
but always either switches the value or prompts to update it.

** =tp-option-str=

A class for reading strings.

Behaviour:

- Format: the value from the server is displayed commented, changed values are highlighted.
- Read: just read a string, with server value as initial input.

** =tp-boolean=

We implement a boolean off =transient-option= rather than using transient's switches because we need to be able to explicitly send request with either boolean value, whereas transient's switches are ignored if set to nil.

Behaviour:

- Format: display the true/false state next to the description
- Read: directly switch or cycle the item's value

=tp-booleans= aren't strictly boolean, they can be used with 2-4 options (more will become unweildy, in which case go with =tp-option=).

* tp methods

Apart from implementing existing transient methods, we define some of our
own.

** =tp-get-server-val=

Fetches the current value from the server. This can be reimplemented if
the data to fetch is in some funky JSON rabbit hole.

** =tp-arg-changed-p=

Compares the option provided against the current value on the server.

* parsing

=tp.el= currently parses JSON data into transient ="key=value= pairs. Nested
values are in dotted =parent.child=value= pairs.

This may change if we implement alist arguments in transient.

JSON data can be complex, and =tp.el= doesn't aim to implement a general
parser. It's also possible that the way to obtain data from an API and the
way it must be sent back differ in terms of nesting and field names, which
makes completely automating or abstracting away the parsing aspect improbable.

** JSON > transient

When setting initial values of the transient, we fetch and parse data from
the server:

=tp-return-data= takes 3 argumements:

- =fetch-fun=, a data fetching function as its first argument, this should
  return JSON data parsed into elisp
- =editable-var= (optional), a list of strings, the names of the JSON fields that the
  data returned should be filtered by. this allows us to parse a limited
  set of our JSON into the transient (eg user settings, where the JSON is
  the whole user object, but not all sections can be edited using a given endpoint)
- =field= (optional), the name of a JSON field whose cdr contains the data
  we want to retain.

In addition, this function calls utility functions to convert boolean values to strings (if =tp-convert-json-booleans-to-strings= is non-nil), and to actually convert the alist to a list of transient args.

** transient > JSON

This step has to be done in a transient's suffix function before sending
data to the server.

=tp-parse-transient-args-for-send= calls three utility functions on a list
of transient arguments for parsing them back into an alist for sending as
request parameters. If you don't want all of them to be called you can
implement them manually.

The two primary functions here are =tp-transient-to-alist= and
=tp-only-changed-args=.

There are also functions for converting lists containing nested argument
keys (ie =parent.child== into =parent[child]==) and lists containing string
booleans back to elisp JSON ones.

* requests

=tp.el= doesn't actually implement any requests. if you want a library for requests, check out https://codeberg.org/martianh/fedi.el.

=fedi.el= also contains utilities for converting the JSON alists that =tp.el= returns into request parameters.
