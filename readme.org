* fedi.el

A library to make writing clients for APIs easier.

It uses code ported from [[https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el][mastodon.el]] to make it easy to write requests for
JSON APIs and build client interfaces.

* http layer

The example macro =fedi-request= allows you to quickly create HTTP requests to
API endpoints, with parameters automatically constructed and sent as form data
or JSON payloads (for POST, PUT, DELETE, and probably PATCH). You should write
your own similar macro in your package. For a working example, see the
[[https://codeberg.org/martianh/lem.el/src/commit/25def6d187caa2bfac238469de81dbaecef757ec/lisp/lem-request.el#L36][lem-request]] macro. That way you can handle package-specific parameters such as
authentication.

Responses are checked with =fedi-http--triage=, and processed with
=fedi-http--process-response=. If a response returns HTML (i.e. for a 404), it
is rendered with =shr=, otherwise the JSON is parsed and returned.

Because of how =mastodon.el= works, there is also code for handling link headers
in responses. Mastodon uses these for pagination in some cases. If your
service also does, you can handle them too.

* utilities

=fedi.el= contains functions for:

- setting up a new view buffer
- navigating between items
- displaying icons
- completing-read action functions
- handling action responses
- updating item display after action
- rendering propertized links for special items (user handles, hashtags, etc.)
- formatting headings
- webfinger lookup of URLs
- and live-updating, human-readable timestamps.

* posting

=fedi-post.el= contains functions for rich composing of posts. It supports:

- pretty display of available bindings
- toggling post flags like NSFW
- completion of items like handles and tags.

* clients using =fedi.el=

- [[https://codeberg.org/martianh/lem.el][lem.el]] (Lemmy client)
- [[https://codeberg.org/martianh/fj.el][fj.el]] (Forgejo client)

* contributing

If you're making an Emacs client for a fediverse (or similar API) service and interested
in using this library, don't hesitate to get in touch. It's easy to adapt for the sake of other needs.
