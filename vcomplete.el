;;; Commentary:

;; Vcomplete provides a minor mode enhancing the default completion
;; list buffer, providing visual aids for selecting completions.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Enable `vcomplete-mode':
;;
;; (vcomplete-mode)
;;
;; For use-package users:
;;
;; (use-package vcomplete
;;   :config
;;   (vcomplete-mode))
;;
;; When `vcomplete-mode' is active:
;; - The completion list buffer opens and updates automatically (see
;;   `vcomplete-auto-update').
;; - The completion list buffer can be controlled through the
;;   minibuffer (during minibuffer completion) or the current buffer
;;   (during in-buffer completion), if it's visible.
;; - The currently selected completion is highlighted in the
;;   completion list buffer.
;;
;; C-n moves point to the next completion.
;;
;; C-p moves point to the previous completion.
;;
;; M-RET (C-M-m) chooses the completion at point.
;;
;; More commands can be added through `vcomplete-command-map':
;;
;; (define-key vcomplete-command-map (kbd "C-a") #'my-command)
;;
;; You can customize `vcomplete-mode' using the customize interface:
;;
;; M-x customize-group RET vcomplete RET
;;
;; For more information see info node `(Vcomplete)'.
