1 Introduction
**************

Gnosis consists of a note taking module (‘org-gnosis’) and a self
testing module.

   Users can use each module independently, but Gnosis is designed for a
workflow that starts with writing a note on a topic.  After completing a
note, the user creates themas (questions/flashcards) for that topic,
which are used for reviews based on the *note Gnosis Algorithm::.

2 Getting started Tutorial
**************************

To follow this tutorial, clone the demo deck available at codeberg

   Demo Deck: <https://codeberg.org/thanosapollo/gnosis-demo>

   Import it to your gnosis collection via ‘M-x gnosis-import-deck’

* Menu:

* Gnosis Dashboard::
* Linking Themata to Note Topics::


File: gnosis.info,  Node: Gnosis Dashboard,  Next: Linking Themata to Note Topics,  Up: Getting started Tutorial

2.1 Gnosis Dashboard
====================

The first thing new users should familiarize themselves with is
‘gnosis-dashboard’, which you can access via ‘M-x gnosis-dashboard’.

   You can start a review session from the dashboard by pressing ‘r’ or
with ‘M-x gnosis-review’.

   NOTE: Gnosis supports reviewing specifics topics for notes of
‘org-gnosis’ with ‘M-x gnosis-review-topic’

   You can add new themata from the dashboard ‘a’ or with ‘M-x
gnosis-add-thema’


File: gnosis.info,  Node: Linking Themata to Note Topics,  Prev: Gnosis Dashboard,  Up: Getting started Tutorial

2.2 Linking Themata to Note Topics
==================================

We can create a demo note topic for Vancomycin, an antibiotic, with ‘M-x
org-gnosis-find RET Vancomycin’.  For this demo, just save the buffer
contents by pressing ‘C-x C-s’.

   Back to the dashboard ‘M-x gnosis-dashboard’, we can view all our
themata by pressing ‘n’ or we can press ‘s’ to search our themata.  For
this demo, we are looking for a thema from the demo deck we imported,
that contains a questions about ‘Vancomycin’.

   To link that thema to the note topic we created before, press ‘e’ to
edit the thema.  In the ‘Keimenon’ section delete "Vancomycin" and press
‘M-x org-gnosis-insert RET Vancomycin’.

   After saving the thema with ‘M-x C-c C-c’, you can review all themata
linked to that topic by ‘M-x gnosis-review-topic’.

3 Thema Types
*************

Each note is a *thema* consisting of the following components:

   • *Keimenon*; The main text or question.
   • *Hypothesis*; Assumptions/hints for the text to guide to the right
     answer
        • For example this is used as hints for cloze type or as choices
          in MCQs
   • *Answer*; The correct response or solution to the keimenon.
   • *Parathema*; expansion of keimenon, that can include links to e.g
     org-gnosis topics or even files, serving as a way to link
     org-gnosis topics to current thema.

   Optionally, you can use also add tags for each note.

   Themas can have multiple hypotheses and answers (*depending on their
type*), separated by ‘gnosis-export-separator’, which defaults to
‘"\n-"’ _(a new line followed by a dash)_.

3.1 Cloze
=========

A cloze note type is a format where you create sentences or paragraphs
with "missing" words.  A fill-in-the-blanks question.

   You can create a cloze note type using ‘M-x gnosis-add-thema’ and
selecting ‘Cloze’.

   Example format:

* Menu:

* Default cloze format::
* Using anki-like syntax::

     ** Hypothesis
     -

     ** Answer
     -

     ** Parathema


   You can format clozes like Anki if you so prefer with hints; e.g
‘{{c1::Cyproheptadine::drug name}}’
   • You can use the keyword ‘::’ to indicate a hint.

   • For each cX-tag there will be created a cloze type note, the above
     example creates 2 cloze type notes.

   • Each cX tag can have multiple clozes, but each cloze must be a
     *UNIQUE* word, or a unique combination of words, in given note.

        • If a cloze is repeated, such as in phrases with "acetyl" &
          acetylcholine, include whitespace in the cloze to denote a
          single word.

     ** Keimenon
     A 60-year-old man comes to the physician with chills, nausea, and
     diffuse muscle aches for 3 days. His niece had similar symptoms 2
     weeks ago and H3N2 influenza strain was isolated from her respiratory
     secretions. He received his influenza vaccination 2 months ago. His
     temperature is 38.5°C. A rapid influenza test is
     positive. Which of the following mechanisms best explains this
     patient's infection despite vaccination?

     ** Hypothesis
     - Random point mutations within viral genome
     - Complementing with functional viral proteins
     - Exchange of viral genes between chromosomes
     - Reassortment of viral RNA segments
     - Acquisition of viral surface proteins

     ** Answer
     - Random point mutations within viral genome

     ** Parathema
     Random point mutations within the viral genome are responsible for
     antigenic drift, which creates a new virus strain.

4 Linking gnosis themata to org-gnosis content
**********************************************

   • You can create notes using ‘M-x org-gnosis-find’, to link them to a
     gnosis thema use ‘M-x org-gnosis-insert’ to insert a link of said
     topic, either on the keimenon or parathema.

   • You can review gnosis questions that are linked to a topic by using
     ‘M-x gnosis-review-topic’.

***************

* Menu:

* Typos | String Comparison::


File: gnosis.info,  Node: Typos | String Comparison,  Up: Customization

5.1 Typos | String Comparison
=============================

You can adjust ‘gnosis-string-difference’, this is a threshold value for
string comparison that determines the maximum acceptable Levenshtein
distance between two strings, which identifies their similarity

   Let's illustrate with an example:
     (setf gnosis-string-difference 1)

   In this scenario, we set ‘gnosis-string-difference’ to 1.  This
implies that two strings will be recognized as similar if they exhibit a
difference of at most one character edit.

   To demonstrate, 'example' and 'examples' will be recognized as
similar, considering that the latter involves just one additional
character."

6 Gnosis Algorithm
******************

Each gnosis note has a gnosis score, which is a list of 3 values,
(gnosis-plus gnosis-minus gnosis-synolon/total).  Gnosis-synolon is what
is used to determine the next interval upon a successful recall,
gnosis-plus is added to gnosis-synolon upon a successful recall as well,
gnosis-minus is subtracted from gnosis-synolon upon failing to recall a
note's answer.

   Gnosis has 2 special events, one is ‘anagnosis’ _ανάγνωση_ and
‘lethe’ _λήθη_.

* Menu:

* Anagnosis Event::
* Lethe event::
* Proto::


File: gnosis.info,  Node: Anagnosis Event,  Next: Lethe event,  Up: Gnosis Algorithm

6.1 Anagnosis Event
===================

‘Anagnosis’, which means comprehension & recognition of knowledge, is
triggered when the consecutive successful or failed recalls are equal or
greater to anagnosis value.

   When ‘anagnosis’ is triggered by consecutive *successful* recalls,
‘epignosis’ value is added to gnosis-plus.  _Epignosis means accuracy of
knowledge_.

   When ‘anagnosis’ is triggered by consecutive *failed* recalls,
‘agnoia’ value is added to gnosis-minus.  _Agnoia means lack of
knowledge_

   You can set specific values for each deck and tag of the variables
mentioned above by adjusting ‘gnosis-custom-values’.


File: gnosis.info,  Node: Lethe event,  Next: Proto,  Prev: Anagnosis Event,  Up: Gnosis Algorithm

6.2 Lethe event
===============

The ‘Lethe’ event triggers after a certain number of consecutive
failures to recall an answer correctly.

   When this threshold is reached, the next interval is reset to 0.

   For example, with lethe value of 2, upon having 2 consecutive failed
recalls the next review will be set for the current day.


File: gnosis.info,  Node: Proto,  Prev: Lethe event,  Up: Gnosis Algorithm

6.3 Proto
=========

The default initial interval is defined at ‘gnosis-algorithm-proto’, you
can define a custom initial interval for each deck as well.

   ‘gnosis-algorithm-interval’ is a list of numbers, representing the
first initial intervals for successful reviews.  There is no limit on
the length of the list.

   Example:

     (setq gnosis-algorithm-interval '(0 1 2 30))

   Upon each successful note review, the algorithm will increment to the
next interval value: 0 days (0), 1 day later (1), 2 days later (2), and
30 days later.

   Upon failing to review a note without completing it's proto
successful reviews, it's next review date will be on the same date.

7 Editing notes
***************

   • Currently there are 2 ways for editing notes:

        • You can edit a note after review by pressing ‘e’
        • Open ‘gnosis-dashboard’ with ‘M-x gnosis-dashboard’, find the
          note you want to edit and press ‘e’


File: gnosis.info,  Node: Sync between devices,  Next: Interactions with other software,  Prev: Editing notes,  Up: Top

8 Sync between devices
**********************

Gnosis uses git to maintain data integrity and facilitate
synchronization across devices.

   You will need to configure your remote manually.

   Example:

     cd ~/.emacs.d/gnosis # default location for gnosis, no-littering is ~/.emacs.d/var/gnosis
     git init # After completing your first review session, a git repo should have been initialized automatically.
     git remote add origin <remote_url>
     git push --set-upstream origin master

   You can interactively use ‘gnosis-vc-push’ & ‘gnosis-vc-pull’.  As
the name suggests, they rely on ‘vc’ to work properly.

   Depending on your setup, ‘vc’ might require an external package for
the ssh passphrase dialog, such as ‘x11-ssh-askpass’.

   To automatically push changes after a review session, add this to
your configuration:
     (setf gnosis-vc-auto-push t)
     (gnosis-vc-pull) ;; Run vc-pull for gnosis on startup

9 Interactions with other software
**********************************

* Menu:

File: gnosis.info,  Node: emacs-no-littering,  Up: Interactions with other software

9.1 emacs-no-littering
======================

If you are a user of emacs-no-littering
(https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering), you can theme Gnosis
to fit its standards by adding the following snippet to your
configuration:

     (setq gnosis-dir (no-littering-expand-var-file-name "gnosis/"))

   This sets ‘gnosis-dir’ to ‘~/.emacs.d/var/gnosis’, in line with the
folders of other packages.
