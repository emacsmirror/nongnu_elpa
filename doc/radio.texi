@node Overview
@chapter Overview

Radio is a GNU Emacs package that enables users to listen to Internet
radio stations.  Its main focus is in simplicity.  It exposes the
minimum required interface to interact with a list of radio stations
and offloads media playing to an external program configured by the
user.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Package name: @code{radio}

@node Configuration
@chapter Configuration

The following configuration variables allow to customize the behavior
of the package:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@vindex radio-command
@code{radio-command}: Command used to play a radio station.
@item
@vindex radio-stations-alist
@code{radio-stations-alist}: List of radio stations.
@end itemize

The customize interface can be used to configure these variables.
Specifically, the @code{radio} group contains all the relevant
settings.

However, if you prefer to add the configuration into your init file,
then the following code can serve as an example:

@lisp
(customize-set-variable 'radio-command "mpv --terminal=no --video=no")

(customize-set-variable 'radio-stations-alist '(("First station" . "https://example.com/first.aac")
                                                ("Second station" . "https://example.com/second.aac")))
@end lisp

It sets @code{mpv} as media player and registers two radio stations
called ``First station'' and ``Second station'' with their respective
URLs.

@node Usage
@chapter Usage

Radio is mainly controlled by two commands:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@findex radio
@code{radio}: Play a radio station.
@item
@findex radio-stop
@code{radio-stop}: Stop playing current radio station.
@end itemize

When invoked interactively, @code{radio} reads the station name from
the minibuffer, with completion.  Modes like @code{fido-mode} can
greatly improve user experience.

For users that prefer a more visual interface, there exists a third
command:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@findex radio-list-stations
@code{radio-list-stations}: Display a list of all radio stations.
@end itemize

@cindex Tabulated view
@cindex Station list
It opens Radio's tabulated view, which shows the list of configured
radio stations as well as the @t{â–¶} symbol next to the one being
played.  It is controlled through the following key bindings:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@kbd{@key{RET}}: Play the selected radio station.
@item
@kbd{s}: Stop playing the current radio station.
@end itemize
