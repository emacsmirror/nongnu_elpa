Vcomplete NEWS -- history of user-visible changes. -*- mode: outline -*-
See the end of the file for an explanation of the versioning scheme.

* 2.0

** Support built-in completion enhancements introduced in Emacs 29.
Built-in commands are now used when available.  Completions are
highlighted using built-in facilities when available.

** Breaking changes

*** 'vcomplete-with-completions-buffer' has been replaced with
'vcomplete-with-completions-window'.  This breaks the previously
available Embark integration.

*** 'vcomplete-search-range' is no longer used in Emacs 29+.

* 1.2.1

** Remove Embark integration.
Embark integration broke in a non-trivial way, so it has been removed
due to a lack of interest in maintaining it.  This integration is
compatible with older versions of Embark (and will continue to
be compatible with Vcomplete for versions before 2.0) so it is
possible to install it manually from a previous release.

* 1.2

** Fix the completion list window still highlighting completions in some
cases after 'vcomplete-mode' is disabled.

** Improve Embark integration.
Fix Embark 'non-edit commands' not immediately exiting when
'vcomplete-auto-update' is t.
Add (auto loaded) 'vcomplete-embark-mode' which enables Embark
integration.
It is no longer required to explicitly load 'vcomplete-embark.el' to
enable this integration.

** Add 'vcomplete-search-range'.
This custom variable is used to control in which frames the completion
list buffer is searched for during completion.

* 1.1

** Add the 'vcomplete-highlight' face.
This face is used to highlight completions. By default, it is the same
as the built-in 'highlight' face.

** Add 'vcomplete-no-update-commands'.
This custom variable is used to control which commands shouldn't cause
the completions list buffer to update.

** Embark support has been moved to a separate file.
It must be loaded explicitly (using '(require 'vcomplete-embark)' or
similar).

* 1.0

** Make auto updating the completion list buffer more responsive.

** Support commands which use 'completion-in-region' in the minibuffer.

** Add basic Embark support.

** Highlight the completion at point in the completion list buffer
even when using normal navigation commands.

** Remove 'vcomplete-kill-buffer'.
This was done as part of an effort to simplify the code base (since
third party solutions to completion actions exist).

** Optionally automatically update the completion list buffer.
See 'vcomplete-auto-update's documentation string for more information.

* 0.1

** Initial version.

* Versioning scheme
Vcomplete's versioning scheme is inspired by semver (https://semver.org/).
Each version number is of the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (patch may be
omitted if 0).
The MAJOR version is bumped when a user facing variable or function
changes in a way that could cause previous user configuration to
break (where user configuration considered is configuration done
through the customize interface).
A MAJOR version bump is very unlikely.
The MINOR version is bumped when a feature is added in a non-breaking
way.
The PATCH version is bumped when no feature is added (e.g. a version
with only fixes, or changes to documentation).

Note that versions before 1.0 did not follow this scheme.
