    | Yes.  Obviously I've moved on, though I've been slow to admit it

  BUGS:

    * All bugs reported to gnu.emacs.vm.bugs, gnu.emacs.vm.info and directly
      to me are fixed either by the patches posted by others or me.    

    * Probably added numerous new bugs.


  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Better built system based on configure.  Autoloads are generated only
      for those functions marked with the autoload token now, which are mainly
      interactive function.

    * New cleaner source tree layout.

    * My (robf) VM extensions are now activated by default, where it makes
      sense to me.

    * vm-mime-type-converter-alist now also works when replying to messages,
      i.e. for text/html one can use lynx or w3m for the conversion.
      (setq vm-mime-type-converter-alist
	'(("text/html" "text/plain" "lynx -force_html -dump /dev/stdin")))
