# Changelog

## main (unreleased)

### Bugs fixed

- Recognize level-5 section titles (`====== Title`). Previously `adoc-title-max-level` was off by one, so the deepest heading level supported by AsciiDoc was treated as ordinary text. Title promotion/demotion now cycles through all six one-line levels and the five two-line levels independently.

## 0.8.0 (2026-02-21)

### New features

- [#21](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/pull/21): Add support for native font-locking in code blocks.
- [#48](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/pull/48): Add support for displaying images.
- Add font-lock support for Asciidoctor inline macros: `kbd:[]`, `btn:[]`, `menu:[]`, `pass:[]`, `stem:[]`, `latexmath:[]`, `asciimath:[]`.
- [#59](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/59): Add nested `imenu` index support (enabled by default via `adoc-imenu-create-index-function`).
- [#29](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/29): Add `adoc-follow-thing-at-point` to follow URLs, `include::` macros, and xrefs (bound to `C-c C-o` and `M-.`).
- Add tempo templates for role-based text decorations (`[.underline]#text#`, `[.overline]#text#`, `[.line-through]#text#`, `[.nobreak]#text#`, `[.nowrap]#text#`, `[.pre-wrap]#text#`).

### Changes

- Require Emacs 28.1.
- `adoc-enable-two-line-title` now defaults to nil (Asciidoctor deprecated Setext-style titles).
- Remove deprecated AsciiDoc backtick-apostrophe quote styles (`` ``text'' `` and `` `text' ``), which are not supported in Asciidoctor.
- Extract image display code into `adoc-mode-image.el`.
- Extract tempo templates into `adoc-mode-tempo.el`.

### Bugs fixed

- [#52](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/52): Prevent `auto-fill-mode` from breaking section title lines.
- [#36](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/36): Remove `unichars.el` dependency; use built-in `sgml-char-names` instead.
- [#26](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/26): Fix `Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p` when calling tempo templates with a prefix argument.
- [#24](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/24): Fix table delimiter highlighting to support any number of columns (was limited to 4).
- [#9](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/9): Fix broken tempo tests and title template compatibility with lexical-binding `tempo.el`.
- [#62](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/62): Fix image display regex to match paths starting with `.` or `/`.
