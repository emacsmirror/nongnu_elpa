# Changelog

## main (unreleased)

### New features

- New `adoc-title-scaling` defcustom (default `t`) and `adoc-title-scaling-values` list let users disable the variable-height title faces or pick their own scale factors. Set the boolean to nil for uniformly-sized headings, or customise the list to control the level-0..5 heights. Mirrors `markdown-header-scaling`.
- New `adoc-blockquote-face` for the body of `[quote]` and `[verse]` delimited blocks (inherits `font-lock-doc-face`); previously the body was left unfontified.
- New `adoc-highlight-face` for `#text#` / `##text##` highlighted spans (inherits the standard `highlight` face); previously these reused `adoc-gen-face`.
- New `adoc-url-face` (inherits `font-lock-string-face`) for URL targets and standalone URLs / email addresses. Link text inside `[…]` still uses `adoc-reference-face`. URL targets previously reused `adoc-internal-reference-face` (for `http://…[label]` form) or `adoc-reference-face` (for bare URLs), conflating link text and link target.
- New `adoc-metadata-key-face` (inherits `font-lock-variable-name-face`) and `adoc-metadata-value-face` (inherits `font-lock-string-face`) for document attribute entries like `:author: Bozhidar Batsov`. Previously the key used `adoc-meta-face` (the generic markup face) and the value reused `adoc-secondary-text-face`; both now have dedicated semantic faces.

### Changes

- `adoc-gen-face`, `adoc-verbatim-face`, `adoc-secondary-text-face`, and `adoc-replacement-face` now inherit from `font-lock-*` faces instead of hardcoding literal colours. Themes that style the font-lock palette will now style AsciiDoc buffers consistently. Users who relied on the old defaults can restore them via `M-x customize-face`.
- Simplify `adoc-meta-face` to `(:inherit shadow :slant normal :weight normal)` instead of overriding eleven attributes including `:family "Monospace"`. AsciiDoc markup characters now respect the user's font choices and theme `shadow` colour rather than being forced into a monospace family with hardcoded grays.
- Drop the dated 3D button decoration (`:box (:style released-button)`) and hardcoded hex colours from `adoc-command-face` and `adoc-complex-replacement-face`; inherit from `font-lock-builtin-face` instead.
- `adoc-meta-hide-face` no longer hardcodes `gray75`/`gray25` foregrounds; it simply inherits from `adoc-meta-face` so the colour tracks the theme. Customise the face if you want hidden markup to fade further into the background.
- Drop the self-referencing `(defvar adoc-X-face 'adoc-X-face)` boilerplate and the `adoc-delimiter` / `adoc-hide-delimiter` aliases. Font-lock keyword specs now quote face symbols directly. No user-visible change; this is purely an internal cleanup.

### Bugs fixed

- Recognize level-5 section titles (`====== Title`). Previously `adoc-title-max-level` was off by one, so the deepest heading level supported by AsciiDoc was treated as ordinary text. Title promotion/demotion now cycles through all six one-line levels and the five two-line levels independently.

## 0.8.0 (2026-02-21)

### New features

- [#48](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/pull/48): Add support for displaying images.
- Add font-lock support for Asciidoctor inline macros: `kbd:[]`, `btn:[]`, `menu:[]`, `pass:[]`, `stem:[]`, `latexmath:[]`, `asciimath:[]`.
- [#59](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/59): Add nested `imenu` index support (enabled by default via `adoc-imenu-create-index-function`).

- [#26](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/26): Fix `Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p` when calling tempo templates with a prefix argument.
- [#24](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/24): Fix table delimiter highlighting to support any number of columns (was limited to 4).
- [#9](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/9): Fix broken tempo tests and title template compatibility with lexical-binding `tempo.el`.
- [#62](https://github.com/bbatsov/adoc-mode/issues/62): Fix image display regex to match paths starting with `.` or `/`.
