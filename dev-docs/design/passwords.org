* Password interaction for IMAP/POP clients
** Call tree hierarchy
   - M-x vm, vm-get-new-mail and timers
     - vm-check-for-spooled-mail, vm-get-spooled-mail (interactive arguments)
       - vm-establish-new-foler-imap-session (interactive argument)
	 - vm-imap-make-session uses `vm-imap-ok-to-ask'
	   for both passwords and questions about downloads
** Kyle Jones's versions
  - Variables like `vm-imap-ok-to-ask'.
  - Set in vm-check-for-spooled-mail, vm-get-spooled-mail-normal and
    vm-establish-new-folder-imap-session, which had an `interactive' argument.
  - The `interactive' was nil when the operations were invoked by timers.
    They were `t' in all other cases, including M-x vm.
  - Also set to `t' in vm-read-imap-folder-name, vm-create-imap-folder
  - It was used in vm-imap-move-mail to ask questions about downloads.
  - Also used in vm-imap-make-session to ask for passwords
** Version 804 (2010-05-29), specifically 801.1.1
   - An `interactive' argument was added to vm-imap-make-session.
   - This was used for asking for passwords, but `vm-imap-ok-to-ask' is
     continued to be used for asking about downloads.
   - vm-imap-imap-check-mail was changed to make this argument `nil'
   - vm-imap-save-composition also changed to make it `nil'
   - vm-imap-folder-completion-list set this argument to `t'
** Revision 1000 (2010-12-28)
   - The call to vm-get-spooled-mail in vm made non-interactive (because "it
     is automatic").
** Version 1362 (2012-02-16)
   - interactive argument added for M-x vm, and all its cousins including
     vm-visit-imap-folder. 
   - Used in the call to vm-get-spooled-mail, so that it is now regarded as
     interactive. 
   - It is used in the recursive call to vm to suppress further interaction.
   - Not clear where else it is used.
** Version 1368 (2012-02-28)
   - Log says "fixed the interactive setting in vm".
