;;; Commentary:

;; Workroom provides named "workrooms" (or workspaces), somewhat similar to
;; multiple desktops in GNOME.

;; Each workroom has own set of buffers, allowing you to work on multiple
;; projects without getting lost in all buffers.

;; Each workroom also has its own set of views.  Views are just named
;; window configurations.  They allow you to switch to another window
;; configuration without losing your well-planned current window setup.

;; You can also bookmark a workroom or all your workrooms to restore them
;; at a later time, possibly in another Emacs session.

;; There is always a workroom named "master", which contains all live
;; buffers.  Removing any buffer from this workroom kills that buffer.  You
;; can't kill, rename or bookmark this workroom, but you can customize the
;; variable `workroom-default-room-name' to change its name.

;; All the useful commands can be called with following key sequences:

;;   Key        Command
;;   --------------------------------------
;;   C-x x s    `workroom-switch'
;;   C-x x d    `workroom-kill-view'
;;   C-x x D    `workroom-kill'
;;   C-x x r    `workroom-rename-view'
;;   C-x x R    `workroom-rename'
;;   C-x x c    `workroom-clone-view'
;;   C-x x C    `workroom-clone'
;;   C-x x m    `workroom-bookmark'
;;   C-x x M    `workroom-bookmark-all'
;;   C-x x b    `workroom-switch-to-buffer'
;;   C-x x a    `workroom-add-buffer'
;;   C-x x k    `workroom-remove-buffer'
;;   C-x x K    `workroom-kill-buffer'

;; Here the prefix key sequence is "C-x x", but you can customize
;; `workroom-command-map-prefix' to change it.

;; Adding and removing buffers to/from workrooms can become a burden.  You
;; can automate this process by setting `buffers' slot of `workroom' to a
;; function without arguments returning a list of live buffers.  That list
;; of buffer will be used as the list of buffers of that workroom.  The
;; default workroom is an example of this type of workroom, which uses
;; `buffer-list' for the list of buffers.
