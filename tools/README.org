* Notes to self

Run src_sh[:eval no :exports code]{make} to generate src_sh[:eval no :exports
code]{consts.c} with the Homebrew (latest) version of sqlite3.h on Mac. 

Requires curl, Pandoc and Python.

Not everything in sqlite3.h is required by the Emacs module. The codes listed below are filtered out.

- Anything not present on https://sqlite.org/c3ref/constlist.html
- SQLITE_TRANSIENT, SQLITE_STATIC, SQLITE_SCANSTAT_*

Definitions in src_sh[:eval no :exports code]{consts.c} are guarded by
src_c[:eval no :exports code]{#ifdef} in case the local installation of (older)
SQLite doesn't have them defined. E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC c :eval no :exports code
#ifdef SQLITE_NOTADB
defconst(env, "sqlite-notadb", env->make_integer(env, SQLITE_NOTADB));
#endif
#+END_SRC

Regenerate src_sh[:eval no :exports code]{consts.c} whenever a new version is SQLite is available.
