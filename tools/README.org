* Notes to self

Run ~make~ to generate ~consts.c~ with the Homebrew (latest) version of
~sqlite3.h~ on Mac.

Requires ~curl~, Pandoc and Python 3.

Not everything in ~sqlite3.h~ is required by the Emacs module. The codes listed
below are filtered out.

- ~SQLITE_TRANSIENT~
- ~SQLITE_STATIC~
- ~SQLITE_SCANSTAT_*~
- Anything not present on https://sqlite.org/c3ref/constlist.html

Definitions in ~consts.c~ are guarded by ~#ifdef~ in case the local installation
of (older) SQLite doesn't have them defined. E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC c :eval no :exports code
#ifdef SQLITE_NOTADB
defconst(env, "sqlite-notadb", env->make_integer(env, SQLITE_NOTADB));
#endif
#+END_SRC

Regenerate ~consts.c~ whenever a new version is SQLite is available.
