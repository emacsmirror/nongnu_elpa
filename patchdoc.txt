This is my patch against the greatest mail reader I know: VM!

Kyle is/does not accept non RFC conform changes or code from other people,
thus changes of mine are available as a patch to the VM source.

The documentation of my changes is incomplete and the changes may even cause
new problems or bugs.  Feel free to contact me if you think my patch breaks
something which is working in standard VM.

Personally I am an follower of the XEmacs church and thus some things may not
work with GNU Emacs, nevertheless I am happy if you send me fixes for GNU
Emacs.

*******************************************************************************
INSTALLATION

Copy this patch to the directory containing a clean standard VM source,
which is not patched and apply this patch with:

	patch < vm-X.XX.patch

Then rebuilt the elc files by

	make  

and restart VM, i.e. quit Emacs.

You can ignore any warnings, however error messages indicate that some modules
(partially) will not work, i.e. if other library files are missing or you are
running GNU Emacs.

*******************************************************************************
UPDATES/UPGRADES

Simply running the following command should check for an update and
rebuilt the modified sources.  It requires "wget" to be installed!

	make update

branch from my repository.

# create your own local branch

COMMENTS

This patch provides the following hacks & enhancements and other stuff not
listed here, as I am quite lazy in writing docs. ;c) 

Additional extensions for VM written by myself:
- vm-pine.el	      for draft handling and other Pine inspired functions.
- vm-ps-print.el      for nice ps-printing functions
- vm-rfaddons.el      adds various add-ons to VM
- vm-grepmail a	      grepmail interface for VM
- vm-avirtual.el      brings additional virtual folder selectors and functions
		      for spam tagging
- vm-biff.el	      is a xbiff within VM, notifying you of new mail
- vm-serial.el	      templates for mails, personalized serial mails 
- vm-summary-faces.el face base on virtual selectors 

Additional extensions for VM from other people:
- vm-pcrisis.el	      by Rob Hodges for people with personal crisis which need
		      to rewrite headers automatically. 
- vcard.el            by Noah Friedman <friedman@splode.com> for
  vm-vcard.el	      displaying vcards within VM.

Patches against the VM core (incomplete docs):
- make-autoloads: enhanced output & ignore links
- vm-mime.el:
	* vm-pine patch for attachment handling of continued message drafts
	* mime button displaying file name of attachment
	* write mime filter
	* qp-decoding of disposition parameters like filename etc.
- vm-mouse.el: handling of email-addresses like "mailto:" URLs
- vm-page.el: vm-energize-urls is interactive now, this allows you to easily
	      check URLs in a message you are currently composing.
- vm-reply.el:
	* Proper setting of subject & references when replying to multiple
	  messages.
	* Filtering of MIME types when yanking a message.  Now only those
	  types listed in `vm-included-mime-types-list' are yanked and you
	  will have no attachment mess any more!
- vm-startup.el: vm-mail takes now a subject argument
- vm-vars.el: two new variables for customization (see vm-reply)
	* vm-included-mime-types-list
