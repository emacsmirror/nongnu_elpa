This directory tree holds Radio, a GNU Emacs package that enables
users to listen to Internet radio stations.

You may encounter bugs in this release.  If you do, please report
them; your bug reports are valuable contributions, since they allow us
to notice and fix problems on machines we don't have, or in code we
don't use often.  Please send bug reports using the bug tracking
system of the project at https://github.com/jroimartin/radio/issues.

There are several subdirectories:

'lisp' holds the Emacs Lisp code for Radio.
'doc'  holds the source code for the Radio Manual.  If you modify the
       manual sources, you will need the 'makeinfo' program to produce
       an updated manual.  'makeinfo' is part of the GNU Texinfo
       package; you need a suitably recent version of Texinfo.
