This is NOT the original VM from http://www.wonderworks.com/vm!

Hail Kyle!

This is Robert Widhopf-Fenk's version from http://www.robf.de/Hacking/elisp!

Read INSTALL and follow the instructions.

VM's home page on the World Wide Web is at http://www.wonderworks.com/vm .
You can get the latest version of VM from there.

The documentation of my changes is incomplete and the changes may even cause
new problems or bugs.  Feel free to contact me if you think my patch breaks
something which is working in standard VM.

Personally I am an follower of the XEmacs church and thus some things may not
work with GNU Emacs, nevertheless I am happy if you send me fixes for GNU
Emacs.

*******************************************************************************
BUGS

Report any problems or bugs otherwise they cannot be fixed!

Post them to the USENET groups gnu.emacs.vm.bugs or gnu.emacs.vm.info!

Or use M-x vm-submit-bug-report to report bugs.

*******************************************************************************
UPDATES/UPGRADES

Simply running the following command should check for an update and
rebuilt the modified sources.  It requires "wget" to be installed!

	make update

WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE ALL LOCAL CHANGES TO THE SOURCES!

If you want to maintain a hacked version of VM and stay in sync with me, see
the next section on BZR.

BZR (http://bazaar-vcs.org/)

I maintain my changes by BZR now, since CVS sucks and TLA/BAZ do as well.

If you want to send me changes or start hacking on your own you may want to 
branch from my repository.

# create your own local branch
bzr get http://www.robf.de/Hacking/bazaar/vm
# get updates
bzr pull
# start hacking 
xemacs vm-pgg.el
# commit your changes 
bzr commit
# Generate a bundle of your changes for merge into the mainline 
bzr bundle-revisions --output=xy-changes.diff
# Attach the bundle to a mail (rather than doing cut&paste) and send
# it to hack@robf.de with a descriptive subject.

COMMENTS

This patch provides the following hacks & enhancements and other stuff not
listed here, as I am quite lazy in writing docs. ;c) 

Additional extensions for VM written by myself:
- vm-pine.el	      for draft handling and other Pine inspired functions.
- vm-ps-print.el      for nice ps-printing functions
- vm-rfaddons.el      adds various add-ons to VM
- vm-grepmail a	      grepmail interface for VM
- vm-avirtual.el      brings additional virtual folder selectors and functions
		      for spam tagging
- vm-biff.el	      is a xbiff within VM, notifying you of new mail
- vm-serial.el	      templates for mails, personalized serial mails 
- vm-summary-faces.el face base on virtual selectors 

Additional extensions for VM from other people:
- vm-pcrisis.el	      by Rob Hodges for people with personal crisis which need
		      to rewrite headers automatically. 
- vcard.el            by Noah Friedman <friedman@splode.com> for
  vm-vcard.el	      displaying vcards within VM.

Patches against the VM core (incomplete docs):
- make-autoloads: enhanced output & ignore links
- vm-mime.el:
	* vm-pine patch for attachment handling of continued message drafts
	* mime button displaying file name of attachment
	* write mime filter
	* qp-decoding of disposition parameters like filename etc.
- vm-mouse.el: handling of email-addresses like "mailto:" URLs
- vm-page.el: vm-energize-urls is interactive now, this allows you to easily
	      check URLs in a message you are currently composing.
- vm-reply.el:
	* Proper setting of subject & references when replying to multiple
	  messages.
	* Filtering of MIME types when yanking a message.  Now only those
	  types listed in `vm-included-mime-types-list' are yanked and you
	  will have no attachment mess any more!
- vm-startup.el: vm-mail takes now a subject argument
- vm-vars.el: two new variables for customization (see vm-reply)
	* vm-included-mime-types-list
