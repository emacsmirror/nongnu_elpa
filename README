Vcomplete - Visual completions

NOTE: Emacs 29 includes (alternative implementations of) most features
of this package, with the only big omission being the live updating of
the completion list buffer.  I have recently decided to stop using
this specific feature, and so I've also decided to stop using and
developing this package.  It is pretty much complete and bug free AFAIK
(except for a few minor issues with the live updating mechanism).

Vcomplete provides a minor mode which highlights the completion at
point the completion list buffer and (optionally) automatically
updates it.

Installation:

From NonGNU ELPA:

M-x package-install RET vcomplete RET

From the repository:

Clone the repository:

$ git clone 'https://git.sr.ht/~dsemy/vcomplete'

Build the package:

$ cd vcomplete

$ make

Install the package:

M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/clone/vcomplete-VERSION.tar RET

Usage:

Enable ‘vcomplete-mode’:

(vcomplete-mode)

For use-package users:

(use-package vcomplete
  :config
  (vcomplete-mode))

When vcomplete-mode is active:
- The completion list buffer opens and updates automatically (see
  ‘vcomplete-auto-update’).
- The completion list buffer can be controlled through the
  minibuffer (during minibuffer completion) or the current buffer
  (during in-buffer completion), if it's visible.
- The currently selected completion is highlighted in the completion
  list buffer.

C-n moves point to the next completion.

C-p moves point to the previous completion.

M-RET (C-M-m) chooses the completion at point.

More commands can be added through ‘vcomplete-command-map’:

(define-key vcomplete-command-map (kbd "C-a") #'my-command)

You can customize ‘vcomplete-mode’ using the customize interface:

M-x customize-group RET vcomplete RET
