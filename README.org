* isearch-light

An Isearch replacement for Emacs.

Provide multi matching, a real minibuffer, no unexpected quit or
errors and comprehensive mode-line indicators.

It aims to keep simple with only the needed features, no extra
features you will never use.

** install

No installation from Melpa and package.el is provided and will be provided.

*** From source

Add isearch-light.el to =load-path=.

Then add =(require 'isearch-light)= in your init file.

Even better, you can autoload it:

#+begin_src elisp
    (autoload 'isl "isearch-light" nil t)
#+end_src

With =use-package= and binding =C-s=

#+begin_src elisp
    (use-package isearch-light
      :bind (("C-s" . isl)))
#+end_src

*** With [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]]

#+begin_src elisp
    (use-package isearch-light
      :straight (isearch-light :host github :repo "thierryvolpiatto/isearch-light")
      :bind (("C-s" . isl)))
#+end_src

** Usage

=M-x src=

The mode-line give you several infos, arrows up/down tell you the
direction where you are actually moving, the =>= and =<= mean you are
either below or above initial position in buffer. Regex, Multi or Literal
tell you the style of search you are using.

Here the commands available:

| C-s    | isl-goto-next             |
| C-r    | isl-goto-prev             |
| <down> | isl-goto-next             |
| <up>   | isl-goto-prev             |
| RET    | isl-exit-at-point         |
| C-w    | isl-yank-word-at-point    |
| M-r    | isl-change-matching-style |
| M-<    | isl-goto-first            |
| M->    | isl-goto-last             |
| M-s    | isl-jump-to-helm-occur    |

** About multi matching

By default =isl= use multi matching like Helm, with limitation to
symbol, not line like in Helm, that's mean "foo bar" match "foo-bar"
or "bar-foo" but not a line with "foo" and "bar" inside e.g. "foo some
text bar", when you want to match something like this you have to use
regexp e.g. "foo.*bar".

To use multi matching, separate text with one space, each pattern
beginning by "!" will mean match everything but this, e.g. "foo !bar"
will not match "foo-bar" but will match "foo-baz".

Note: You can jump to =helm-occur= for a line based search.
You can also jump to [[https://github.com/victorhge/iedit][iedit-mode]] with multi match pattern.

** Use isearch-light for helm-help

Starting from Emacs-27 Isearch works more or less with unexpected
effects, you have better time using =isl= as the search command for
helm-help, here how to replace default setting by `isl` in helm-help:

#+begin_src elisp
    (use-package helm-lib
      :config
      (use-package isearch-light
        :straight (isearch-light :host github :repo "thierryvolpiatto/isearch-light"))
      (helm-help-define-key "C-s" nil)
      (helm-help-define-key "C-r" nil)
      (helm-help-define-key "C-s" 'isl))
#+end_src

An alternative is to customize `helm-help-hkmap` from the customize interface.
