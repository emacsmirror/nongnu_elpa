#+TITLE: Wfnames

Allows editing filenames.

* Features

Allows editing lists of absolute files, this allows editing the
directory parts as well.

Modified lines are highlighted, maybe in a different color when about
to overwrite an existing file.

File completion is provided.

Not tighted to a directory, allows editing files from various
directories.

Do not provide edition of permissions and will not.

* Motivation

Wdired must be patched to allow editing a list of absolute filenames
in Emacs versions before Emacs-29.
Only Helm is doing this.

* Install

This package have no user interface, but you can easily use it with Helm
by defining yourself action and command for helm-find-files:

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun helm-ff-wfnames (_candidate)
    (let ((marked (helm-marked-candidates :with-wildcard t)))
      (wfnames-setup-buffer marked)))

  (helm-make-command-from-action helm-run-wfnames
      "Run wfnames from HFF."
    'helm-ff-wfnames)
  (define-key helm-find-files-map (kbd "C-x C-q") 'helm-run-wfnames)
  
  (use-package wfnames
      :config
    (setq helm-find-files-actions
          (helm-append-at-nth
           helm-find-files-actions
           '(("Edit filename(s)" . helm-ff-wfnames)) 2)
          wfnames-create-parent-directories t
          wfnames-interactive-rename nil))
