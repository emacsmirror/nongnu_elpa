#+title: IWindow - Interactively manipulate windows

The default command for switching window in ~other-window~, which is
great for two windows, but unpredicatable and cumbersome when there
are more windows.  This package aims to solve that, by allowing to
select any window with a few keystrokes.

* Usage

Use ~iwindow-select~ to select window.  It is recommended to bind it
to somewhere, for example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x o") #'iwindow-select)
#+end_src

You can swap windows with ~iwindow-swap~.  To delete a window, you can
use ~iwindow-delete~.  And there is ~iwindow-delete-others~ to delete
all window except the chosen one.

* Installation
