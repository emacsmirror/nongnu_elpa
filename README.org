* blueprint-ts-mode
Major mode for Blueprint ([[https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler/]]) based on Treesitter.

* Installation
You need Emacs version >= 29. Your Emacs also needs to be compiled with Treesitter support (~--with-tree-sitter~) which you can check with the variable ~system-configuration-options~.

Get the grammar:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'treesit-language-source-alist
               '(blueprint . ("https://github.com/huanie/tree-sitter-blueprint")))
  (treesit-install-language-grammar 'blueprint)
#+end_src

Install ~blueprint-ts-mode~ from NONGNU ELPA. ~package-install blueprint-ts-mode~.
