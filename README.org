* isearch-light

An Isearch replacement for Emacs.
It aims to keep simple with only the needed features, no extra
features you will never use.

#+end_src

With =use-package= and binding =C-s=

#+begin_src elisp
    (use-package isearch-light
      :bind (("C-s" . isl)))
#+end_src

*** With [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][Straight]]

#+begin_src elisp
    (use-package isearch-light
      :straight (isearch-light :host github :repo "thierryvolpiatto/isearch-light")
      :bind (("C-s" . isl)))
#+end_src
