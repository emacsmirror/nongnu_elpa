#+title: Blow - Blow away mode lighters

Mode lighters are indicator that make us aware that a mode is enabled.
This is helpful, but when there are too many of them, it becomes a
problem, because often lighters with the important information gets
truncated due to the non-important lighters.  So we blow them, and
they are usually the lighters of the important, perhaps indispensible,
modes for you, so that you can see and focus on what matters.

* Usage

Using this package is simple:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Enable `blow-mode'.
(blow-mode +1)

;; Blow the lighter of `gcmh-mode'.
(blow 'gcmh-mode)

;; Change the lighter of `eldoc-mode' to `ELispDoc' (with a preceding
;; space to differentiate from other lighters.
(blow 'eldoc-mode " ElispDoc")

;; Show the lighter of `paredit-mode' unless the major mode is
;; `emacs-lisp-mode'.
(blow 'paredit-mode '(:eval (unless (eq major-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode)
                              (blow-original-lighter 'paredit-mode))))

;; Revert `eldoc-mode' lighter.
(blow-revert 'eldoc-mode)
#+end_src

Or, if you prefer customizing variable, set ~blow-mode-list~ from
custom, or customize it from your init file like the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; You can also use `setq', but you would need to reenable `blow-mode'
;; for changes to effect.
(customize-set-variable
 blow-mode-list

 ;; Blow the lighter of `gcmh-mode'.
 '((gcmh-mode nil)

   ;; Change the lighter of `eldoc-mode' to `ELispDoc' (with a
   ;; preceding space to differentiate from other lighters.
   (eldoc-mode " ElispDoc")

   ;; Show the lighter of `paredit-mode' unless the major mode is
   ;; `emacs-lisp-mode'.
   (paredit-mode (:eval (unless (eq major-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode)
                          (blow-original-lighter 'paredit-mode))))))

;; Enable mode to take effect.
(blow-mode +1)
#+end_src

* Installation

~blow~ isn't available on any ELPA right now.  So, you have to follow
one of the following methods:

** Quelpa

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(blow :fetcher git
               :url "https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-blow.git"))
#+end_src

** Straight.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(blow :type git :repo "https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-blow.git"))
#+end_src

** Manual

Download the ~blow.el~ file and put it in your ~load-path~.
