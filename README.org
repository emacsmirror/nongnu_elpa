* Supported version control systems

Current only two version control systems are supported:

- Git
- Mercurial (note: changes must be saved to be shown)

* Usage

Type =M-x why-this-mode= to enable showing blame.

Type =M-x why-this= to show blame on echo area.

Type =M-x why-this-annotate= to show editing history on a dedicated buffer.

* Configuration

Put the following in your init file to enable ~why-this-mode~ in every
possible buffer:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-why-this-mode)
#+end_src

Note: ~why-this-mode~ won't be enabled on unsupported buffer.

Output by ~why-this-annotate~ may be hard to read depending on the theme.
Put the following in your init file to change the colors:

- For dark theme users:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-cold "#203448")
  (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-warm "#382f27")
  #+end_src

- For light theme users:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-cold "#dde3f4")
  (set-face-background 'why-this-annotate-heat-map-warm "#f0e0d4")
  #+end_src

To disable the heat map:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq why-this-annotate-enable-heat-map nil)
#+end_src

Hovering on the message shows a tooltip, to disable it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq why-this-enable-tooltip nil)
#+end_src

To see all user options =M-x customize-group RET why-this=.
