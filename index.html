    <h1>BZR repository for VM</h1>

  <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">BZR</a> is a distributed version control
  system which is really great.  

  <p>
  BZR quick start:
  <code>
  <pre>
    # Checkout a local working copy of VM
    bzr get http://www.robf.de/Hacking/bazaar/vm
    
    # Some days later you want to pull new changes
    bzr pull
    
    # Now you decide to hack on VM and commit your changes
    xemacs vm-mime.el
    bzr commit
    
    # Generate a bundle of your changes for merge into the mainline
    bzr bundle-revisions --output=xy-changes.diff
    # Attach the bundle to a mail (rather than doing cut&paste) and send it to
    # hackATrobfDOTde.
    
    # Now we have diverged branches, so you need to merge my changes into your tree
    bzr merge
    # And commit them!
    bzr commit -m "synced with mainline"
    
    # If we are in sync after the merge, pull should work again
    ... </pre></code>
